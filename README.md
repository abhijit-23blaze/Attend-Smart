# Attend Smart

## Overview

This project addresses the common challenges associated with traditional paper-based attendance systems. By leveraging modern technologies, we have created a robust and secure attendance system that ensures accuracy, efficiency, and real-time data management.

### Problems Addressed

- *Manual Attendance:* Traditional paper-based attendance systems are time-consuming and prone to errors.
- *Fraudulent Attendance:* Easy for students to mark attendance for others, leading to inaccurate records.
- *Time Consumption:* Professors spend significant time taking attendance, reducing valuable teaching time.
- *Data Management:* Difficulties in managing and storing large volumes of attendance data securely.
- *Verification Issues:* Lack of a reliable method to verify student identity during attendance.
- *Lack of Real-time Data:* Inability to access real-time attendance data for immediate insights and decision-making.

## Tech Stack

This solution is built using the following technologies:

- *Flutter:* Cross-platform mobile application framework for creating a user-friendly interface.
- *Firebase SDK:* Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) for real-time database management, authentication, and cloud storage.
- *MetaMask Extension:* Enables blockchain-based authentication and transaction management.
- *Google ML Kit:* Machine Learning SDK for on-device detection and recognition.
- *Google Maps API:* Used for location-based services and geofencing.
- *Solidity:* Programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
- *Dart:* Programming language used with Flutter for front-end development.

- *EthInd - Blockchain:* Blockchain network for managing decentralized transactions and data.
- *React:* JavaScript library for building the web interface.
- *Node.js:* Backend runtime environment for server-side application logic.
